@thesis{nachtigall_dispersion_2016,
  title = {The dispersion of two immiscible fluids is part of many processes in chemical, pharmaceutical or food industry. Resulting drop size distributions thereby determine the efficiency of several processes, but also the stability and rheology of the resulting emulsions. Nevertheless no reliable model for the description of drop size distributions is available in literature. Consequently, drop breakage and drop coalescence, which determine the drop formation, still need to be investigated in more detail. This work focuses on drop breakage; aim is the improvement of the physical understanding of drop breakage mechanism in turbulent flow. Comprehensive experiments were conducted and the behavior of single drops in the turbulent vicinity of a single stirrer blade of a Rushton turbine was analyzed by high-speed imaging. At least 1000 drops were examined for each parameter set. Image data was evaluated fully automatically and the breakage probability and location, as well as the resulting daughter drops were determined. Furthermore, a method was developed in order to describe the dynamics of the drop breakage process properly. Finally the comparability of single drop breakages with the behavior of drop size distributions in breakage dominated stirred systems was discussed. This work shows different breakage mechanisms occurring in the turbulent flow field. Especially breakage of fluids with higher viscosity or breakage of smaller drops is more complex. In that case synergetic effects of different breakage mechanisms are most probable. More than one eddy can be involved in the breakage process and an influence of eddies with different sizes is also possible. In general such behavior was found with increasing breakage resistance, which is defined through the relation between stabilizing and deforming stresses. The experimentally determined breakage rate is only influenced by the breakage resistance. No critical value for the macroscopic drop deformation, which must be exceeded for fragmentation, can be derived from experimental results. Only for higher viscosity drops such a critical value cannot be excluded. These drops generally show more pronounced deformations than drops with low viscosity. Furthermore, the deformations take more time and more oscillations prior the fragmentation occur. The behavior of the breakage rate is at least qualitatively comparable to those of the Sauter mean diameter in breakage dominated stirred dispersions. Also the drop size distributions behave comparable in both set ups.},
